# 5512-Final_Project 
Using Time Series Algorithms for Predicting Global Land Temperatures for Major Cities

- Emily Moeller, [ecmoeller]
Developed in Python 3.7 (It will still run with Python 3.6 but the print statements will look ugly)

I primarily developed this program in jupyter notebooks, so to run a jupyter notebook you need to download Anaconda 
from this link https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Then, you simply run all cells within the notebook.

Alternatively, you also can run 

$ pip install statsmodels
$ python majorcitytemps.py
